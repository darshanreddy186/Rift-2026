# Rift-2026 Money Muling Detection
# 💰 Graph-Based Financial Crime Detection Engine  
## Money Muling Detection System – RIFT 2026 Hackathon

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Money muling is a major financial crime technique where illicit funds are transferred through networks of accounts to hide the original source of money.

Traditional SQL-based systems fail to detect:
- Multi-hop laundering
- Circular fund routing
- Smurfing patterns
- Layered transaction rings

This project builds a **Graph-Theory-Based Financial Crime Detection Engine** to identify suspicious mule networks using transaction graph analysis.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

We convert financial transactions into a **directed graph**:

- **Nodes** → Bank Accounts  
- **Edges** → Transactions  
- **Edge Weight** → Transaction Amount  
- **Timestamp** → Temporal Analysis  

Using graph algorithms, we detect suspicious transaction patterns and assign risk scores.

## 🔎 Detection Patterns Implemented

### 1️⃣ Circular Fund Routing (Cycles)

Money flows in a loop:
A → B → C → A

- Detect cycles of length 3–5  
- All accounts in the cycle are flagged under the same `ring_id`

---

### 2️⃣ Smurfing (Fan-In / Fan-Out)

- Many small incoming transactions to one account (Aggregator)
- One account distributing funds to many accounts

---

### 3️⃣ Rapid Layering

Funds transferred across multiple accounts within a short time window:
---

### 4️⃣ High-Risk Clusters

Dense transaction subgraphs with:
- High connectivity
- Abnormal transaction frequency
- Suspicious volume concentration

---

## 🧮 Suspicion Scoring Model

Each account receives a **Suspicion Score (0–100)** based on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Cycle Participation | High |
| Smurfing Behavior | Medium |
| Rapid Layering | High |
| Volume Anomaly | Medium |
| Ring Connectivity | High |

Risk Levels:
- 🟢 Low Risk  
- 🟡 Medium Risk  
- 🔴 High Risk
